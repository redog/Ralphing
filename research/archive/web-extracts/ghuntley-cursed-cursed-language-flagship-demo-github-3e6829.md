# ghuntley/cursed — CURSED Language Flagship Demo (GitHub)

Category: ralph-loops-origin

---

An esoteric programming language that combines Go-like semantics with Gen Z slang keywords, featuring the world's first use of Among Us
ඞcharacters in pointer syntax.
CURSED is a statically typed, garbage-collected programming language designed to make coding more expressive and culturally relevant while maintaining practical functionality. It's self-hosting through a multi-stage bootstrap compiler written in Zig.
- Gen Z Slang Keywords: Core programming constructs use contemporary slang (slayfor function,susfor variable,vibefor package,stanfor goroutine)
- Among Us Pointer Syntax: First programming language to use ඞ(U+0D9E) for pointer operations
- Go-like Semantics: Familiar control flow and typing for experienced developers
- Built-in Concurrency: Goroutines (stan) and channels (dm) for concurrent programming
- Advanced Memory Management: Generational garbage collector with performance monitoring
- Comprehensive Error Handling: yikes/fam/shookerror system with panic recovery

    sus is_cool lit = based      // boolean (true)
    sus height snack = 5.8       // 32-bit float
    
    // Pointer operations with Among Us syntax

    sus value normie = *ptr      // dereference

- Git
The CURSED compiler is now implemented in Zig with built-in LLVM support, eliminating external LLVM dependencies and enabling cross-platform compilation including Windows.

CURSED has evolved through multiple implementation phases:
- ✅ Stage 0: Environment setup and language design
- ✅ Stage 1: Zig-native compiler with LLVM backend
- 🚧 Stage 2: Advanced features and optimization
- 🔮 Stage 3: Self-hosting compiler in CURSED
Current Status: Full compiler implemented in Zig with comprehensive language support, built-in LLVM backend, and extensive test suite including 17+ LeetCode problems.
