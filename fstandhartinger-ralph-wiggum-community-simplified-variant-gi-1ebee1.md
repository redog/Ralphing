Ralph Wiggum (in this flavour) combines Geoffrey Huntley's original iterative bash loop with SpecKit-style specifications for fully autonomous AI-assisted software development.
- 🔄 Iterative Self-Correction — Each loop picks ONE task, implements it, verifies, and commits
- 📋 Spec-Driven Development — Professional specifications with clear acceptance criteria
- 🎯 Completion Verification — Agent only outputs <promise>DONE</promise>when criteria are 100% met
- 🧠 Fresh Context Each Loop — Every iteration starts with a clean context window
- 📝 Shared State on Disk — IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.mdpersists between loops
Based on [Geoffrey Huntley's methodology](https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum):

The agent outputs <promise>DONE</promise> ONLY when:
- All acceptance criteria are verified
- Tests pass
- Changes are committed and pushed
The shell or PowerShell loop checks for this phrase. If not found, it retries.
| Mode | Purpose | Command | 
|---|---|---|
| build (default) | Pick spec/task, implement, test, commit | ./scripts/ralph-loop.sh | 
| plan (optional) | Create detailed task breakdown from specs | ./scripts/ralph-loop.sh plan | 
On Windows PowerShell, use the matching .ps1 scripts, for example
.\scripts\ralph-loop.ps1 or .\scripts\ralph-loop-codex.ps1 plan.
Most projects work fine directly from specs. The agent simply:
- Looks at specs/folder
- Picks the highest priority incomplete spec
- Implements it completely
Only use plan mode when you want a detailed breakdown of specs into smaller tasks.
Tip: Delete IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to return to working directly from specs.
Point your AI agent to this repo and say:
"Set up Ralph Wiggum in my project using
[https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum](https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum)"
The agent will read [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) and guide you through a lightweight, pleasant setup:
- Quick Setup (~1 min) — Create directories, download scripts
- Project Interview (~3-5 min) — Focus on your vision and goals, not technical minutiae
- Constitution — Create a guiding document for all future sessions
- Next Steps — Clear guidance on creating specs and starting Ralph
The interview prioritizes understanding what you're building and why over interrogating you about tech stack details. For existing projects, the agent can detect your stack automatically.
See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for step-by-step manual instructions.
Tell your AI what you want to build, or use /speckit.specify in Cursor:
/speckit.specify Add user authentication with OAuth
This creates specs/001-user-auth/spec.md with:
- Feature requirements
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria (critical!)
- Completion signal section
The key to good specs: Each spec needs acceptance criteria that are specific and testable. Not "works correctly" but "user can log in with Google and session persists across page reloads."
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh planCreates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with detailed task breakdown. This step is optional — most projects work fine directly from specs.
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh        # Unlimited iterations
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh 20     # Max 20 iterationsEach iteration:
- Picks the highest priority task
- Implements it completely
- Verifies acceptance criteria
- Outputs <promise>DONE</promise>only if criteria pass
- Bash loop checks for the phrase
- Context cleared, next iteration starts
Every loop run writes all output to log files in logs/:
- Session log: logs/ralph_*_session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log(entire run, including CLI output)
- Iteration logs: logs/ralph_*_iter_N_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log(per-iteration CLI output)
- Codex last message: logs/ralph_codex_output_iter_N_*.txt
If something gets stuck, these logs contain the full verbose trace.
Each spec tracks how many times it has been attempted. After 10 attempts without completion, the spec is flagged as "stuck" and should be split into smaller specs.
# Check stuck specs
source scripts/lib/nr_of_tries.sh
print_stuck_specs_summaryThe counter is stored as a comment in the spec file:
<!-- NR_OF_TRIES: 5 -->Get progress updates via Telegram! See [TELEGRAM_SETUP.md](https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum/blob/main/TELEGRAM_SETUP.md) for setup.
# Enable telegram (requires TG_BOT_TOKEN and TG_CHAT_ID)
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh
# Enable audio notifications (also requires CHUTES_API_KEY)
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh --telegram-audio
# Disable telegram
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh --no-telegramWhat you'll get:
- 🚀 Loop start notifications
- ✅ Spec completion notifications with mermaid diagrams
- ⚠️ Warnings for consecutive failures or stuck specs
- 🏁 Summary when loop finishes
On each spec completion, entries are created in completion_log/:
- YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM-SS--spec-name.md— Summary and mermaid code
- YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM-SS--spec-name.png— Rendered mermaid diagram
These provide a visual history of what was built.

The constitution is the single source of truth. Optional features (Telegram, GitHub Issues, completion logs) are configured there — not baked into the scripts.
Each iteration gets a clean context window. The agent reads files from disk each time.
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md persists between loops. Agent reads it to pick tasks, updates it with progress.
Tests, lints, and builds reject invalid work. Agent must fix issues before the magic phrase.
Agent only outputs <promise>DONE</promise> when acceptance criteria are 100% verified. The bash loop enforces this.
Trust the AI to self-identify, self-correct, and self-improve. Observe patterns and adjust prompts.
During installation, you can choose:
- SpecKit Specs (default) — Markdown files in specs/
- GitHub Issues — Fetch from a repository
- Custom Source — Your own mechanism
The constitution and prompts adapt accordingly.
