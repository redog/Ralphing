Autonomous orchestration framework for Claude Code with MemPalace-inspired memory, parallel-first Agent Teams, Aristotle First Principles methodology, and quality gates.
Ralph extends Claude Code into a multi-agent development framework with a structured memory system inspired by the [Memory Palace technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci). Every task is analyzed from first principles, decomposed into parallel subtasks, assigned to specialized teammates, and validated through quality gates before completion.
| Capability | Description | 
|---|---|
| MemPalace Memory | 4-layer memory stack (L0-L3) with Obsidian vault knowledge graph and learned rules taxonomy | 
| Parallel-First | All independent tasks execute in parallel via Agent Teams (mandatory for complexity >= 3) | 
| 6 Teammates | ralph-coder, ralph-reviewer, ralph-tester, ralph-researcher, ralph-frontend, ralph-security | 
| Hook System | Lifecycle hooks for validation, quality gates, security guards, and automatic learning | 
| Aristotle Analysis | 5-phase first principles deconstruction before every non-trivial task | 
| Quality Gates | 4-stage blocking validation: correctness, quality, security, consistency | 
| Comprehensive Tests | Full test suite covering layers, hooks, security, skills, and pipeline | 
Inspired by the [MemPalace repository](https://github.com/tcsenpai/mempalace) (Memory Palace technique for LLM agents), Ralph implements a layered memory architecture with key differences based on our implementation findings.
| Layer | File | Purpose | 
|---|---|---|
| L0 | ~/.ralph/layers/L0_identity.md | Agent identity + principles | 
| L1 | ~/.ralph/layers/L1_essential.md | Actionable rules (filtered from corpus) | 
| L2 | .claude/rules/learned/{halls,rooms,wings}/ | Project-specific taxonomy (on-demand) | 
| L3 | Obsidian vault grep | Full knowledge base queries (on-demand) | 
Rules organized in 3 dimensions for flexible retrieval:
| Dimension | Directory | Organization | 
|---|---|---|
| Halls (by type) | .claude/rules/learned/halls/ | decisions, patterns, anti-patterns, fixes | 
| Rooms (by topic) | .claude/rules/learned/rooms/ | hooks, memory, agents, security, testing | 
| Wings (by scope) | .claude/rules/learned/wings/ | _global/,multi-agent-ralph-loop/ | 
These findings emerged during our MemPalace implementation and may be relevant to others building LLM memory systems:
| Finding | Detail | 
|---|---|
| Encoding doesn't reduce tokens | Unicode PUA encoding increased BPE tokens. Word count metrics falsely reported reduction. | 
| Selection beats encoding | Choosing fewer rules achieved the target; compressing the same rules did not. | 
| Taxonomy needs noise filtering | 46% of auto-learned rules were noise (cross-domain repeats, vague bundles). Filtering is essential. |

SESSION (any repo)
  |
  +-- Stop      --> continuous-learning.sh --> vault + procedural memory
  +-- PostToolUse --> semantic extractors  --> vault facts & decisions
  +-- SessionStart --> vault-graduation.sh --> promote to local rules
  +-- SessionEnd   --> vault-index-updater  --> update indices
All learning flows project -> global -> vault. Only universal patterns graduate to global scope.

/security src/6 specialized teammates for parallel execution:
| Teammate | Role | Tools | 
|---|---|---|
| ralph-coder | Implementation | Read, Edit, Write, Bash | 
| ralph-reviewer | Code review (OWASP) | Read, Grep, Glob | 
| ralph-tester | Testing | Read, Edit, Write, Bash(test) | 
| ralph-researcher | Research (Zai MCP) | Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch | 
| ralph-frontend | Frontend (WCAG 2.1 AA) | LSP, Read, Edit, Write, Bash | 
| ralph-security | Security (6 pillars) | LSP, Read, Grep, Glob, Bash | 
Agent Teams is enabled via CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 in settings.json. Teammates are spawned in parallel by the orchestrator, iterate, parallel, security, and task-batch skills.
| Skill | Purpose | 
|---|---|
| /orchestrator | Full 10-step workflow: evaluate, clarify, classify, plan, execute, validate, retrospect | 
| /iterate | Iterative execution until VERIFIED_DONE | 
| /parallel | Run multiple independent tasks concurrently | 
| /task-batch | Autonomous batch execution from PRD files | 
| /gates | Multi-language quality gate validation | 
| /security | Multi-agent security audit (OWASP, semgrep, gitleaks) | 
| /autoresearch | Autonomous experimentation loop with Smart Setup | 
| /adversarial | Spec refinement with multi-model cross-validation | 
| /bugs | Systematic bug hunting | 
| /ship | Pre-launch checklist (gates + security + review) | 
| /spec | Verifiable technical specification before coding | 
4-stage validation, all blocking except consistency:
- CORRECTNESS -- Syntax valid, logic sound
- QUALITY -- Types, no debug artifacts
- SECURITY -- semgrep + gitleaks + OWASP validation
- CONSISTENCY -- Linting and style (advisory)
Hook enforcement via TeammateIdle and TaskCompleted events ensures no agent completes without passing gates.
All independent tasks MUST execute in parallel. Sequential execution requires documented dependency.
Complexity 1-2: Direct execution (no team required)
Complexity 3+:  Agent Teams with parallel teammates (MANDATORY)

The framework includes multiple layers of security enforcement:
| Layer | Trigger | Purpose | 
|---|---|---|
| git-safety-guard.py | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks destructive git operations and command chaining | 
| repo-boundary-guard.sh | PreToolUse (Bash) | Prevents operations outside current repo | 
| audit-secrets.js | PostToolUse | Audit logging for 20+ secret patterns | 
| teammate-idle-quality-gate.sh | TeammateIdle | Quality gates before teammate goes idle | 
| task-completed-quality-gate.sh | TaskCompleted | Multi-gate validation before task completion | 
| task-plan-sync.sh | TaskCreated | Syncs task creation to plan-state.json | 
Ralph uses symlinks (not copies) for all global rules, skills, and agents. This eliminates content duplication and reduces context overhead by ~29% (~10K tokens saved per session).
# Sync rules from repo to global (creates symlinks)

# Preview changes without executing

}Skills are symlinked to multiple platform directories. Source of truth: .claude/skills/ in this repo.
All Ralph advantages (Plan Mode, Aristotle, Parallel-First, Agent Teams) work in any project -- rules, skills, and agents are symlinked globally.

Smart Setup reduces configuration from 14+ manual parameters to 2-3 guided questions:
| Phase | Name | What it does | 
|---|---|---|
| 0 | SCOUT | Silent auto-detection of project type, scripts, metrics | 
| 1 | WIZARD | 2-3 AskUserQuestion with pre-filled options and previews | 
| 2 | VALIDATE | Dry-run verification (eval works, metric extracts, git clean) |
